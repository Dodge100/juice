# Eclipse of Darkness

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
A 2D metroidvania meets platformer meets boss rush like if Hollow Knight and Celeste had a baby.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
    Shadow hopping, you can teleport from shadow to shadow
    Dash, quickly sprint forward covering a short distance without losing any altitude
    Double/Triple Jump, allows for a second jump in the air (no coyote jumping but you can fall down and then jump again)
    However, these abilities become more restricted in brighter areas
    Damage abilites (lower damage in light) to help fight the bosses.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
You need to complete platformer levels to defeat different lieutenants of the light. The game will be boss fights spaced in between platformer levels with a progressive increase in difficulty for both the bossfights and platformer sections. If I have time, there will also be a boss rush game mode where you can purely fight the bosses.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
The game will slowly ramp up in difficulty keeping you hooked. I will try to integrate fun bossfights with each boss having unique mechanics and attack patterns while also allowing for players to go on side quests (which will be harder than the main route) but will end up giving advantages in boss fights.
